Also, I create content on my instagram with the purpose of sharing my day to day work inspiring and helping others. Because of my passion of creating content I came back to photography doing it as a hobbie. For a while, I had the opportunity to create content for a coffee shop. Oh! that's another thing I love, drinking good coffee!"

I have worked also with Java, Typescript and Angular, but not my main tools. For designing, I work with AdobeXD. Before any design I do, I start with a pencil and paper. To build websites or landing pages I use Jekyll, but recently I started developing them with React and GatsbyJS. For my photography work, the unique and the best ones, Lightroom and Photoshop."
